    <h1>SIGNALDECK (BETA)</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>1. Yes, it’s another trading journal.</strong><br>
        You’ve seen a hundred of these, and most are just glorified tax software. They show you what happened, but they don't tell you <em>why</em> your behavior is shifting. I built SignalDeck because I was tired of Excel lying to me. Most journals treat a win as a win, but they miss the "Strategic Drift"—the invisible gap where your execution starts decaying before the drawdown actually hits.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2. I built this for my own desk.</strong><br>
        This wasn't a "startup idea." I’m a trader and a dev who needed a better way to audit my own discipline. I use this every single day to catch my own slumps before they get expensive. I’m opening it up for beta now because I’ve hit a wall on my own and I want to see how other serious traders break it so I can make it even more robust.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>3. I didn't spend a dime on marketing.</strong><br>
        You’ve probably noticed this site is just plain text. I didn’t waste money on a marketing team to try and trick you into a subscription. I spent that time building the Health & Sync manager, the AI audit layer, and the duration-vs-R logic. I’d rather have an ugly site with a powerful engine than a pretty site that tells me nothing useful.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>4. I’m losing money on this (happily).</strong><br>
        I’ll probably never turn a profit here. Between server costs and AI API calls, I’m paying over a hundred bucks a month just to keep the lights on. I’m fine with that if it means I get to build the ultimate audit tool. In exchange for your feedback, beta testers get free access for life, obtaining Founding Member status. If for some reason this blows up and I'm charging crazy monthly prices for it - you'll continue to use it for free. If this never grows outside of some beta testers - fine. I'll continue to keep it online and use it myself with you alongside me.
    </p>

    <h2>KEY FEATURES</h2>
    <div class="feature-list">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI Forensic Layer:</strong> Use Gemini 1.5 Flash to audit your journal notes against your raw execution data. Ask it to "Review my stop loss discipline" to find the behavioral gaps where your strategy and execution diverge.</li>
            <li><strong>Regime Detection:</strong> Track <strong>Win Rate Velocity</strong> and <strong>Expectancy Momentum</strong> on a rolling 20-trade basis. These act as early warning systems, flagging strategy decay before it hits your equity curve.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk & Expectancy Metrics:</strong> Comprehensive tracking of <strong>SQN Score</strong>, <strong>Kelly Criterion</strong>, and <strong>Profit Factor</strong> to ensure your system has a measurable edge.</li>
            <li><strong>Execution Auditing:</strong> Automatic calculation of <strong>Execution Delta</strong> (Signal vs. Fill) and <strong>Duration vs. R-Multiple</strong> scatter-plots to find your "Negative Expectancy Zone"—the exact minute where winners turn into losers.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Drawdown Analysis:</strong> Real-time monitoring of <strong>Current vs. Max Drawdown</strong> and <strong>Pessimistic Est. Max DD</strong> to flag when a strategy is likely broken.</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional Grade Metrics:</strong> Access <strong>MFE/MAE (Maximum Favorable/Adverse Excursion)</strong>, <strong>R-Multiple Trends</strong>, and other institutional-grade metrics that other journals simply don't have.</li>
            <li><strong>Health & Sync Manager:</strong> Live monitoring of data feed health to ensure your metrics are never based on stale or desynced data.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Reporting:</strong> Download your entire trade history that includes every metric I can think of adding to the database. This helps for internal review or use of LLM or Machine Learning auditing as your strategies grow.</li>
            <li><strong>Concierge Backfill:</strong> If you can provide a csv dump of your past trades in your broker(s) - most allow this - I'll upload into your database and backfill your data with no charge.</li>
            <li><strong>And More!</strong> - I'm actively working with Quants and people smarter than myself to add additional features as this product grows.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Q: What trading styles does this support?</strong><br>
        A: All styles—day trading, swing trading, position trading, algorithmic, discretionary. If you track trades with entry/exit prices, this works.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Do I need coding knowledge?</strong><br>

        A: Yes. Export a CSV from your broker and I'll personally backfill it. Most brokers allow historical exports going back years.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: What's the AI actually doing?</strong><br>
        A: It analyzes YOUR journal notes against YOUR trade data to find specific behavioral patterns. It's not generic advice.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How much cash you making from this bro?</strong><br>
        A: Bish please. I ain't here making nothing. Best believe this 'un.</p>
